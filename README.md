## Overview

### Program Structure

The virtual experience program comprises the following tasks:

1. **Data Audit and Analysis**:  
   - **Objective**: Assess the client's big data practices and analyze sample datasets to understand content popularity.  
   - **Deliverables**:  
     - Data cleaning and preprocessing.  
     - Analysis of content categories to identify the top 5 with the largest popularity.  
     - Visualizations to support findings.  
   - **Files**:  
     - `File.ipynb`  

### Repository Structure

- **Data Files**:  
  - `Content.csv`: Contains information about content items.  
  - `Location.csv`: Includes data on content locations.  
  - `Profile.csv`: User profile data.  
  - `ReactionTypes.csv`: Different types of reactions available.  
  - `Reactions.csv`: User reactions to content.  
  - `Session.csv`: Session data for user interactions.  
  - `User.csv`: User demographic information.  
  - `data.csv`: Consolidated dataset for analysis.  

- **Notebook**:  
  - `File.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and visualizations.  

- **Miscellaneous**:  
  - `.DS_Store`: System file (can be ignored).  
  - `LICENSE`: License information for the repository.
